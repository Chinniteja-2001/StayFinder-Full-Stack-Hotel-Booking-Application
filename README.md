Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building RESTful APIs and managing business logic.
Hibernate: An ORM tool for database interactions, facilitating easy data management.
Spring Security: Provides security features for user authentication and authorization.
PostgreSQL: A relational database for storing user, booking, and hotel data.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication and session management.


Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
Bootstrap CSS: A framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
Backend Features


RESTful API Development:

Developed a set of RESTful APIs to manage bookings, user accounts, and room inventories. This includes endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting booking information.

Database Schema Design:

Designed a relational database schema in PostgreSQL that accommodates various entities such as Users, Hotels, Rooms, and Bookings. Utilized Hibernate to manage one-to-many relationships between users and their bookings, as well as hotels and their available rooms.

User Authentication and Authorization:

Implemented Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization. This includes secure login processes, role-based access control, and protected routes for different user roles (admin and customer).

Modular Architecture:

Created a modular architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability. The codebase is organized into distinct packages based on functionality, which makes it easier to manage and extend in the future.

Testing and Quality Assurance:

Conducted extensive testing using Postman to validate the functionality of APIs. This included testing for edge cases, ensuring robust exception handling, and confirming that the APIs return the expected responses in various scenarios.


Frontend Features

Responsive User Interface:

Built a fully responsive hotel booking website using React.js and Bootstrap CSS. The design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Real-time Data Integration:

Integrated APIs to fetch real-time data on hotel availability, room details, and booking information. This allows users to view up-to-date information when searching for hotels.

Dynamic Content Updates:

Implemented dynamic content updates using React Hooks. This enhances the user experience by allowing components to update in real-time without the need for full-page reloads, making the application more interactive and responsive.

User-Friendly Booking Process:

Designed an intuitive user interface for browsing hotels, selecting rooms, and making reservations. The booking process is streamlined to minimize user input and maximize clarity, helping users to complete their reservations efficiently.

Error Handling and Feedback:

Integrated user-friendly error handling and feedback mechanisms throughout the application. Users receive clear messages for any errors that occur during the booking process, ensuring a smooth and transparent experience.
